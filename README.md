# RESTful API for User Management

This project represents an implementation of a RESTful API for user management using Spring Boot.

## Task Description
The task consists of two parts:
1. Learning about RESTful API design principles and best practices.
2. Implementing the RESTful API for user management based on a Spring Boot web application.

### Resources
- [RESTful API Design: Best Practices in a Nutshell](https://restfulapi.net/)
- [Error Handling for REST with Spring | Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/rest-api-error-handling-best-practices)
- [Testing in Spring Boot | Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-testing)
- [Testing | Spring](https://spring.io/guides/gs/testing-web/)
 
### Requirements
1. **User Fields:**
    - Email (required): Validation against email pattern.
    - First Name (required)
    - Last Name (required)
    - Birth Date (required): Value must be earlier than the current date.
    - Address (optional)
    - Phone Number (optional)

2. **Functionality:**
    - Create User: Registration of users who are more than 18 years old (age value from properties file).
    - Update User Fields: Partial or complete update of user information.
    - Delete User
    - Search Users by Birth Date Range: Validation ensuring "From" date is less than "To" date. Returns a list of users.

3. **Testing:**
    - Unit tests using Spring framework.

4. **Error Handling:**
    - Proper error handling for RESTful responses.

5. **Response Format:**
    - API responses should be in JSON format.

6. **Database Usage:**
    - Data persistence layer is not required.

# Implementation Details

## In-Memory User Repository Implementation

For the purpose of this assignment, a simple in-memory repository was implemented to manage user data. Since database connectivity was not required, users are stored in a map using a separate implementation. Here are the key features of this implementation:

- **Data Storage**: User data is stored in an in-memory map, providing a lightweight and efficient way to manage user records.

- **Unique Email Validation**: When creating or updating a user, the repository ensures that each user's email is unique. This is achieved by performing a check against existing user emails before adding or updating a user.

- **Auto-Generated IDs**: Each user is assigned a unique ID automatically when they are created. This ID is incremented atomically to ensure uniqueness across users.


- Implemented CRUD operations for user management.
- Added validation for user fields such as email pattern and phones.
- Developed error handling for RESTful responses.
- Ensured API responses are in JSON format.
- Covered the code with unit tests using Spring framework.

- **Swagger** was used to document the RESTful API endpoints implemented in the Spring Boot application. Here are the key points regarding the Swagger documentation:

## Docker Setup for Project

A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml were created to facilitate the deployment and running of the project in a Docker environment.
